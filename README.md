My choices in colour and font are mostly linked to my exploration of maming myslef a portfolio site. The main headings (<h1>) are the Inter font because it is the same font currently on my CV.
The colour scheme Is leaning more towards warmer tones. I'd like to play around with some more saturated highlights aornd the page in future.
The validation of my stylesheet was done in the same manner as my HTML. Run it through the W3C CSS Validation Service and fixed any errors that it flagged.
I'd definiatle like to expore the flexibility of the elemnets themsleves and placement of the page.
